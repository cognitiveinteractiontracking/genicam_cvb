# Debugging the PTP behaviour of the JAI cameras

Info: The cameras are requested with 40 frames per second

* `cam1_log.log`: This camera seems to reboot after a few frames
* `cam2_log.log`: This camera runs as a PTP listener, but the timestamp is very strange
* `cam3_log.log`: This camera runs with the internal clock
